The easiest way to make screenshots of your blocks.

== Description ==
What if I told you that you could take a screenshot of individual blocks (or multiple blocks if you group them) with just the click of the mouse?

You can with blockshots.

#### Sorta experimental
This is one of those plugins that we made just to see if it could be done. It would be very hard to test every combination of blocks so if you run into any trouble please let us know as then we can work on making it even better.

#### I like this, who made it?
This plugin is brought to you by [sorta brilliant](https://sortabrilliant.com/) and [block garden](https://block.garden).

== Screenshots ==
1. Click and your done.

== Changelog ==
* 1.0.2 Bump "Tested up to" WordPress version.
* 1.0.1 Update "Tested up to" WordPress version.
* 1.0.0 Initial Commit.
